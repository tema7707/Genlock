# Genlock Showcase
Welcome to the Genlock Showcase! This is a web service that utilizes Generative AI technologies to create unique game assets. This platform can be used by game companies to enhance their user's gaming experience by generating assets in their own style and offering them as NFTs.

## Overview
The Genlock Showcase is a REST API server that allows you to upload images of existing gaming assets. We will then use these images to train a model that generates new, unique assets. Each generated asset will be provided as an NFT that can be integrated into your web 3 game.

** This is just an example of what can be done with Genlock. The Genlock Showcase is a simple game that calls our API to demonstrate the functionality of Genlock. **

## How to Run
Install dependencies: `yarn`
Start the development server: `yarn start`
